# Tecno-Spark-10-Root-Guide
⚠️ DISCLAIMER & WARNING
This guide is provided for informational and educational purposes only. Proceeding with these steps means you understand and accept the following risks:

DATA LOSS: Unlocking the bootloader (Step 3) will FACTORY RESET your device, wiping all user data, photos, apps, and internal storage contents. BACK UP ALL IMPORTANT DATA FIRST!

WARRANTY VOID: Unlocking the bootloader and rooting your device will almost certainly VOID YOUR MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY with Tecno/Infinix.

SECURITY RISK: An unlocked bootloader compromises the integrity of Android's Verified Boot (AVB) security. You will see a permanent "Orange State" warning message every time you boot your phone, indicating the device is "untrusted."

APP FAILURE: Security-sensitive applications (banking, payment systems like Google Wallet, and certain streaming services) may stop working due to root detection (SafetyNet/Play Integrity API failure). This requires extra steps (Part 6) to fix.

RISK OF BRICKING: Incorrectly following the flashing steps, or flashing files not intended for your specific device model (TECNO-KI5q), can result in a permanent brick (unusable device). Proceed entirely at your own risk.

The author of this guide is not responsible for any damage, loss of data, or voided warranties resulting from the use of this information.
